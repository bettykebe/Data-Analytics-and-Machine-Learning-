What column to merge on?
Chicago provides a list of taxicab owners and vehicles licensed to operate within the city, for public safety. Your goal is to merge two tables together. One table is called taxi_owners, with info about the taxi cab company owners, and one is called taxi_veh, with info about each taxi cab vehicle. Both the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables have been loaded for you to explore.

Choose the column you would use to merge the two tables on using the .merge() method.

 on='rid'
 on='vid'
 on='year'
 on='zip'
Your first inner join
You have been tasked with figuring out what the most popular types of fuel used in Chicago taxis are. To complete the analysis, you need to merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables together on the vid column. You can then use the merged table along with the .value_counts() method to find the most common fuel_type.

Since you'll be working with pandas throughout the course, the package already loaded in the first cell for you as pd in each exercise in this course. The data reading lines for the taxi_owners and taxi_veh DataFrames from a pickle file are also provided in the first two lines on the following cell.

Instructions

Read the taxi_ownders.p file and store it in DataFrame taxi_owners and the taxi_vehicles.p file and store it in DataFrame taxi_veh.
Take a look at the columns of each DataFrame and decide which column to use for the inner merge.
Merge the two DataFrames and store it intwo taxi_owner_veh DataFrame. Set the left and right table suffixes for overlapping columns of the merge to _own and _veh, respectively.
Display the first rows from taxi_owner_veh.
Select the fuel_type column from taxi_owner_veh and print the value_counts() to find the most popular fuel_types used.

Inner joins and number of rows returned
All of the merges you have studied to this point are called inner joins. It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows with matching values in both tables. You will explore this further by reviewing the merge between the wards and census tables, then comparing it to merges of copies of these tables that are slightly altered, named wards_altered, and census_altered. The first row of the wards column has been changed in the altered tables. You will examine how this affects the merge between them.

The wards, census, wards_altered and census_altered DataFrames are loaded from the source pickle files in the first four lines of the following cell.

For this exercise, it is important to know that the wards and census tables start with 50 rows.

Instructions

Merge wards and census on the ward column and save the result to wards_census.
Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column, and notice the difference in returned rows.
Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column, and notice the difference in returned rows.

One-to-many classification
Understanding the difference between a one-to-one and one-to-many relationship is a useful skill. In this exercise, consider a set of tables from an e-commerce website. The hypothetical tables are the following:

A customer table with information about each customer
A cust_tax_info table with customers unique tax IDs
An orders table with information about each order
A products table with details about each unique product sold
An inventory table with information on how much total inventory is available to sell for each product
One-to-one

The relationship between products and inventory. The relationship between customer and cust_tax_info.
One-to-many

The relationship between the products and orders. The relationship between the customers and orders.

One-to-many merge
A business may have one or multiple owners. In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, called biz_owners, to the licenses table. Recall from the video lesson, with a one-to-many relationship, a row in the left table may be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. In this lesson, you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)

The licenses and biz_owners DataFrames are loaded in the first two lines of the following cell.

Instructions

Starting with the licenses table on the left, merge it to the biz_owners table on the column account, and save the results to a variable named licenses_owners.
Group licenses_owners by title and count the number of accounts for each title. Save the result as counted_df
Sort counted_df by the number of accounts in descending order, and save this as a variable named sorted_df.
Use the .head() method to print the first few rows of the sorted_df.

Total riders in a month
Your goal is to find the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station (station_name == 'Wilson') when riding Chicago's public transportation system on weekdays (day_type == 'Weekday') in July (month == 7). Luckily, Chicago provides this detailed data, but it is in three different tables. You will work on merging these tables together to answer the question. This data is different from the business related data you have seen so far, but all the information you need to answer the question is provided.

The cal, ridership, and stations DataFrames have been loaded for you in the first three lines of codes in the codecel below. The relationship between the tables can be seen in the diagram below.

Chica_diagram.png

The cal table relates to ridership via year, month, and day. The ridership table relates to the stations table via station_id.

Instructions:

Merge the ridership and cal tables together, starting with the ridership table on the left and save the result to the variable ridership_cal. If you code takes too long to run, your merge conditions might be incorrect.
Then extend the previous merge to three tables by also merging the stations table and assigning the result to ridership_cal_stations.
Create a variable called filter_criteria to select the appropriate rows from the merged table so that you can sum the rides column.

Three table merge
To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are. A table with the median income by zip code has been provided to you. You will merge the licenses and wards tables with this new income-by-zip-code table called zip_demo.

The licenses and wards are loaded in one of the previous codecells and zip_demo DataFrames have been loaded for you in the first line of code in the codecell given below.

Instructions:

Starting with the licenses table, merge to it the zip_demo table on the zip column. Then merge the resulting table to the wards table on the ward column. Save result of the three merged tables to a variable named licenses_zip_ward.
Group the results of the three merged tables by the column alderman and find the median income.

[12]
#Load land_use DataFrame from the dataset file
zip_demo = pd.read_pickle("https://github.com/DataAnalyst21/DatasetsForDataAnalytics/blob/main/zip_demo.p?raw=True")


# Merge the licenses table with zip_demo on zip
licenses_zip = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on='zip')

# Merge the resulting table with wards on ward
licenses_zip_ward = licenses_zip.merge(wards, on='ward')

# Print the results by alderman and show median income
print(licenses_zip_ward.groupby('alderman').agg({'income':'median'}))

One-to-many merge with multiple tables
In this exercise, assume that you are looking to start a business in the city of Chicago. Your perfect idea is to start a company that uses goats to mow the lawn for other businesses. However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.

The census and licenses tables have been loaded in one of the previous codecells and land_use is loaded in the first line of the codecell below.

Instructions:

Merge land_use and census on the ward column. Merge the result of this with licenses on the ward column, using the suffix _cen for the left table and _lic for the right table. Save this to the variable land_cen_lic.
Group land_cen_lic by ward, pop_2010 (the population in 2010), and vacant, then count the number of accounts. Save the results to pop_vac_lic.
Sort pop_vac_lic by vacant, account, and pop_2010 in descending, ascending, and ascending order respectively. Save it as sorted_pop_vac_lic.
